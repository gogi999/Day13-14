    Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The
    main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body
    than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady
    speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a
    form of aerobic endurance training. Jogging is running at a gentle pace, its
    definition, as compared with running, is not standard. One definition
    describes jogging as running slower than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h). Running
    is sometimes defined as requiring a moment of no contact to the ground,
    whereas jogging often sustains the contact.
